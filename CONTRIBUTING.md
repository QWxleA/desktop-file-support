## About

### The extension
This extension only uses [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)'s declarative language
features. The idea is to keep the extension very small and portable.

### License
All contributions to this project are done under the [**MIT License**](LICENSE).

## Before you open an issue
The project is still fairly new, so far, only 2 issue have been opened. But in the future, there may
be more. Search through the issues to see if somebody has already asked the same question, reported
the same bug, requested the same feature, or had the same idea as you.

Know that I am working on this alone (at least so far), so, please, be patient.
